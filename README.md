# JILI

This Repository contains a programming language I wrote called JILI. JILI is a functional programming language created with the base language of Racket. The file contains all the code necessary to run the parser and interpreter along with example use cases of the language at the bottom of the file. The file contains all the supported values, types, and expressions as well as the process by which the code is translated from concrete syntax to JILI structs, value result, and finally a serialized result in the form of a string.

In order to run the .rkt file you will need an application like Dr.Racket or need to add an extension to an existing IDE.
