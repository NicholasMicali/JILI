# JILI

This Repositiry contains a programming language I wrote called JILI. JILI is a funcitonal programming laguage creating with the base laguage of Racket.
The file contains all the code necessary to run the parser and interpreter along with example use cases of the language at the bottom of the file. Within the file contains all the supported values, types, expressions as well as the process by which the code is translated from concrete syntax to JILI structs, value result, and finally serialized result in the form of a string. 

In order to run the .rkt file you will need an application like Dr.Racket with tha ability to run racket files or add an extension to an exisitng IDE.
